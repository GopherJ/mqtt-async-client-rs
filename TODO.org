* Bugs


* Enhancements for launch


** Add usage examples
** Timeout on any RPC
*** Timeout on Connack
*** Timeout on Puback
*** Timeout on Suback
*** Timeout on Unsuback
*** Timeout to write a no-response packet
*** If a Client does not receive a PINGRESP Packet within a reasonable amount of time after it has sent a PINGREQ, it SHOULD close the Network Connection to the Server.
** Automated tests
*** Long packets, short packets


* Enhancements


** TLS
   Including:
   - Client uses CA cert to validate server
   - Client certificate and key
** Client connect sends clean session
** Client connect sends last will
** Publish retain flag
** Local persistent buffering
** Offline buffering
** High availablity: fail over to a list of servers on failure to connect
** MQTT over WebSocket
** Automatic reconnect
*** Queue outbound publishes in progress and retry with dup=1 after reconnect.
** Back pressure on write PID allocation?
** Publish QoS level 2 (exactly once)
** Subscribe QoS level 2 (exactly once)
