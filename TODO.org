*** Timeout to write a no-response packet
*** If a Client does not receive a PINGRESP Packet within a reasonable amount of time after it has sent a PINGREQ, it SHOULD close the Network Connection to the Server.
** Automated tests
*** Long packets, short packets

** High availablity: fail over to a list of servers on failure to connect
